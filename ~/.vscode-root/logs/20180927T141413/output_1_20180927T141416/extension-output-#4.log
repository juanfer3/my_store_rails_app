Failed to load the ESLint library for the document /home/jfvilladiego/proyectos_rails/my_store/app/assets/javascripts/application.js

To use ESLint please install eslint by running 'npm install eslint' in the workspace folder my_store
or globally using 'npm install -g eslint'. You need to reopen the workspace after installing eslint.

If you are using yarn instead of npm set the setting `"eslint.packageManager": "yarn"`

Alternatively you can disable ESLint for the workspace folder my_store by executing the 'Disable ESLint' command.
